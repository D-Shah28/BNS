# Blind Navigation System - AI Assistive Navigation Model

## 🚀 Overview
The **Blind Navigation System** is an AI-powered assistive model designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings safely. Using **Object Detection, NLP, and Computer Vision**, the system detects obstacles in real-time and provides voice-based feedback for navigation.

## 🛠 Features
✅ **Real-time Object Detection** using YOLOv5 & OpenCV  
✅ **Speech Recognition & Text-to-Speech** for voice-based interaction  
✅ **GPS & Geolocation-based Navigation**  
✅ **Deep Learning & NLP-powered assistance**  
✅ **Portable & Cost-Effective AI Solution**  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLOv5
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, NumPy
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Geolocation Services**: Geopy

## 🔧 Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blind-navigation-system.git
cd blind-navigation-system
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the System
```bash
python blind_navigation.py
```

## 📌 Usage
- Start the script using `python main.py`.
- The system will detect objects and provide **audio feedback**.
- If using **GPS mode**, the system will guide the user based on location.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Integration with **Edge AI for faster processing**.
- **Mobile App Deployment** for broader accessibility.
- Addition of **more real-time navigation features**.
